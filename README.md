Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app

then in your git bash terminal type > git clone https://github.com/Helo88/UdacityMyReadsProject or download zip file from git hub website 
<br>
then in a new  terminal type  
<b> <i>yarn or yarn install</i></b>
now all of the dependencies have been installed 
finally type <b> <i>yarn start</i> </b> to launch the app
 
A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser .
